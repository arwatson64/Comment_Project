This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank.

Alex, I am pleased with your progress this semester. Your steady improvement on problem sets along with the hard work you have been doing on studying is really paying off in some very strong coding! Your average problem set score was in the A range at an impressive 96%! Your solutions were efficient and thourough, including contingency plans for negatives, decimals, and inputs of zero where other students often forgot to those situations into account. Keep up the good work!Your chapter test average was in the A range at an impressive 94%! Your solutions were efficient and thourough, including contingency plans for negatives, decimals, and inputs of zero where other students often forgot to those situations into account. Keep up the good work!

On your bank customer service simulation partner project, you received a 73% as a fair number of your functions weren't fully completed or effective. Make sure to reach out for help or to ask for an extension when you need it. 

Alex, your final exam score was an impressive 100%! Wow! Your final showed some really excellent work. Your final shows a clear understanding of how to create, use and take advantage of functions, which is a critical and powerful learning goal for this class. Your functions were efficient, easy to read and made good use of your functions within other functions so you did not repeat code. You are doing excellent work, Alex. 

Your grade for the semester is an A. I look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
