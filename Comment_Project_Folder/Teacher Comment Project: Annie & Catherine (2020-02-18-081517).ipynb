Not only did you try (and solve!) every challenge and extra credit problem offered to you, you also encouraged your table mates to do the same, supporting them when they needed it. Your openness and optimism in the face of challenges and setbacks was contagious and made your table group one of the most hard-working and positive I've seen. Perseverance is a clear talent of yours. Your steady improvement on problem sets along with the hard work you have been doing on studying is really paying off in some very strong coding! Your average problem set score was in the A range at an impressive 95%! Your solutions were efficient and thourough, including contingency plans for negatives, decimals, and inputs of zero where other students often forgot to those situations into account. Keep up the good work! Your chapter test average was in the A- range at 91% as a couple solutions in each chapter test failed to account certain situations (e.g. negatives, decimals, or inputs of zero), but your chapter tests on the whole were well done! Paying closer attention to problem instructions and asking for help if you get stuck can bring your average to a solid A in no time! \n"
