This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank.

Peggy, I am concerned with your progress this semester. Your average problem set score was a highly concerning 18% as you never completed a problem set, but turned in partially (sometimes nearly) completed work instead. Your chapter test average was a highly concerning 23% as you never completed a chapter test, but turned in partially (sometimes nearly) completed work instead. Make sure to reach out for help if you don't understand concepts that will be on the test! 

On your bank customer service simulation partner project, you received a highly concerning 33% as you never completed the project, but turned in a partially completed solution instead. Please reach out to me for help or to ask for an extension when you need it. 

Peggy, your final exam score was 24%. Your final showed an extremely poor understanding of how to create, use and take advantage of functions, which is a critical and powerful learning goal for this class. The majority of your functions were nonexistent, and the the absence of docstrings and comments made the little work you did show difficult to guess the intentions behind. Studying could have been helpful for you, Peggy. 

Your grade for the semester is an F. I hope you take to heart the suggestions I've given and try your best to improve as a computer scientist next semester.
